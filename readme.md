**sockit** is a lightweight socket communication library with clients in python and java, with a high-level API.

It was created to support code for  [experiments on sensorimotor learning](http://fabien.benureau.com). It might somehow be useful to you, especially if you want to rerun, check or tweak the aforementioned experiments.

## Installation

1. Get the code
1. `make sockit.jar`
1. Go to `pysockit/`
1. `python setup.py install`

## Usage

You can look at the `test` and `example` target of the makefile.

See the python tests in the `pysockit/sockit/test/` folder.
